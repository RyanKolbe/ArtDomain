## <u>**ArtDomain**</u>

The program is an online portal for artists to showcase their work, arrange exhibitions, arrange purchasing and sales of artwork, etc.



I will be creating a program that allows up and coming artists to showcase there work online. 

1. Arrange exhibitions by uploading details of events for site visitors to have access to. 

2. They will have the option to arrange sales with potential customers by transferring purchase/sale details between buyer and seller. 

   The application will not have the ability to handle actual transactions as this is outside of the scope of my current capabilities.

3. The member and buyer can also arrange for the product details to be made available for a courier company to pick up. 

The focus of the application is transfer of information and not actual monetary transactions.
